# What's this
"RubINT" is a Ruby OSINT tool made by me.

The tool contains lookups for E-Mail, Phone Numbers, Usernames, IPs and Credit Card BINs.

# Disclaimer 

The original idea is NOT mine.

As a matter of fact, this tool is nothing but the Ruby version of the "Osinku" OSINT tool, made by two friends of mine.

# Differences between Osinku and RubINT

1. The lang and the consequences of it (obv)
2. The E-Mail lookup that is now better, using Hunter's API
3. The BIN lookup option
4. The possibility to search for doxbin uploads
5. While OSINKU was only for Windows, RubINT is also for GNU/Linux and MacOS systems

4. Type `ruby rubint.rb` to run the program
