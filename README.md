# What's this
"RubINT" is nothing but a Ruby OSINT tool made by me.

The tool contains lookups for E-Mail, Phone Numbers, Usernames, IPs and Credit Card BINs.

# Disclaimer 

The original idea is NOT mine.

As a matter of fact, this tool is nothing but the Ruby version of the "Osinku" OSINT tool, made by two friends of mine.

# Differences between Osinku and RubINT

1. The lang and the consequences of it (obv)
2. The E-Mail lookup that is now better, using Hunter
3. The BIN lookup
4. The possibility to search doxbin uploads

# RubINT library

Coming soon...
